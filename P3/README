Project 3: mysend/myreceive

sys_mysend works by copying the supplied char* into a kernel char*. Using copy_from_user, this is saved in memory.
sys_myreceive checks to see if the process sending a message exists, and copies the char* at the location in memory to the user.

The test (should) work by creating 3 child processes. Their pids are saved by the parent so each one can access the others. Then, each process sends a message to each other process. Once one process receives at least 2 message, it sends a release message to the other processes, telling them to exit.
